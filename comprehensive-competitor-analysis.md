## 3. What Competitors Are Doing Wrong (Comprehensive — All 60+ Companies)

### 3.1 Almost Nobody Has a Blog
From V1: Only Shark Coatings has a real blog (50+ articles). Titan has 2 posts. Everyone else: nothing.
From V2: Only AmerEpoxy, Epoxy Orlando, Garage Experts, PPI Floors, Leaf Home, Cubix, Creative Resurfacing, National Concrete Polishing, and Concrete Solutions CFL have blogs — but none are robust content strategies. Epoxy Orlando's localized blog posts (Winter Park, Orange County, Kissimmee) is the smartest approach.
TOTAL: ~10 out of 60+ companies have any blog. Only 1 (Shark Coatings) has a real content strategy. This is the single biggest SEO gap.

### 3.2 Thin Service Pages
Most list services but lack detailed, dedicated pages. Dual Stone, Ox Floors, Clever Coatings, Olympus, Wise Coatings, Tru Grit, IBEX, Foxy Epoxy, XT Epoxy, Sun Surfaces all have thin or no service pages.

### 3.3 Missing Testimonials / Social Proof
Despite hundreds of Google reviews, most fail to display them on their websites:
- Shark Coatings: 1,388 reviews → some displayed
- Ox Floors: 501 reviews → only 3 shown
- Garage Living: 137 reviews → only 3 shown
- Dual Stone: 131 reviews → only 4 brief quotes
- Olympus: 91 reviews → zero on site
- Most V2 companies: zero testimonials on site

### 3.4 No FAQ Sections
From V1: Only Titan has FAQ content (without schema markup)
From V2: Apex Epoxy leads with 40+ questions. AmerEpoxy, Epoxy Orlando, Leaf Home, Five Seasons, Lifetime Green, National Concrete Polishing, Concrete Polishing Orlando have basic FAQs
Still only ~8 out of 60+ companies have FAQs. Massive opportunity.

### 3.5 No Before/After Galleries
DreamCrete, Ox Floors, Dual Stone, Olympus, Clever Coatings (V1) all missing. IBEX, Foxy Epoxy, XT Epoxy, Sun Surfaces, Decorative Concrete Experts (V2) all missing. Visual industry but most fail to showcase work.

### 3.6 Poor Technical SEO
- Tru Grit: Wix, JavaScript-dependent
- Clever Coatings: NitroPack makes content invisible
- Dual Stone: No meta descriptions
- Concrete Polishing Orlando: uses contact@mysite.com
- Sun Surfaces: mostly JS/CSS, barely any text
- Decorative Concrete Experts: HTTP only (no SSL)

### 3.7 No Video Content
Zero competitors across ALL 60+ companies use video effectively. Only Garage Experts has a "Video Center." No installation walkthroughs, no video testimonials, no YouTube strategy.

### 3.8 No Pricing Transparency
From V1: Zero of 10 share pricing
From V2: Only Apex Epoxy ($3-$12/sqft) and National Concrete Polishing ($5-$15/sqft) list prices. 2 out of 60+ total.

### 3.9 Weak CTAs
Generic "Contact Us," "Submit," and form submissions. No specific, compelling calls to action.

### 3.10 Financing Almost Non-Existent
Only 3 of 60+ offer financing: Top Coat Epoxy (Wisetack), Leaf Home, Five Seasons Painting ($35/mo). For $2K-$10K+ jobs, financing removes a major barrier.

- Comparison articles (epoxy vs polyaspartic, etc.)
- Florida-specific guides (humidity, UV, hurricane)
- City-specific landing pages for 15-20+ cities

### 7.2 SEO Advantages to Build

| Tactic | Who's Doing It |

| Before/after gallery with alt tags | Nobody does it well |
| Video content on service pages | Nobody (only Garage Experts has video center) |
| Pricing guide page | 2 of 60+ |
| 20+ testimonials displayed | Most show <5 |
| Location pages for 15+ cities | Only Shark & Wise try |
| Blog with 20-30 articles | Only Shark has real blog |
| Floor visualizer tool | Only 2 of 60+ (Lifetime Green, Penntek) |

|---|---|
| No blog | 20-30 SEO-optimized articles |
| Thin service pages | Deep, detailed pages with FAQs (500+ words each) |
| No pricing info | Cost guide page with ranges |

| No floor visualizer | Add visualization tool (only 2 of 60+ have one) |

### 7.4 Competitor-Specific Strategies

**V1 Competitors:**
- Beat Shark Coatings: Their blog is generic, not Orlando-specific. Write better local content. They don't have pricing content.
- Beat Wise Coatings: Proprietary brand but thin website. Out-content them.
- Beat DreamCrete: NASA/Disney clients but no blog, weak service pages.
- Beat Tru Grit: Built on Wix with poor crawlability. Our Astro site outperforms technically. They only target Lakeland.
- Beat Titan: Lifetime warranty (strong) but only 2 blog posts.
- Beat Ox Floors: Factory-direct claim but no pricing content. Only 3 testimonials shown.
- Beat Dual Stone: No service pages, no blog, no location targeting.
- Beat Clever Coatings: Almost no visible content.
- Beat Olympus: Veteran-owned but zero testimonials and no blog.
- Beat Garage Living: Franchise focused on full renovation, not just coatings.

**V2 Competitors:**
- Beat AmerEpoxy: Best local site but can be outmatched with more content volume and pricing transparency.
- Beat Leaf Home: National resources but generic template content. Win with authentic local depth.
- Beat Granite Garage Floors: Professional franchise but cookie-cutter. Win with local authority.
- Beat franchise competitors generally: They all have template sites. Authentic local content always wins for local search.
- Beat painting company crossovers (Five Seasons, IBEX): Position as specialist. "We don't paint houses — we're epoxy flooring experts."
- Beat keyword domain owners (orlandoepoxyflooring.com, epoxyorlando.com, decorativeconcreteorlando.com, concreteresurfacingorlando.com, concretepolishingorlando.com): They own the domains but waste them with thin content. Superior content on our domain + proper SEO outranks them.

### 7.5 Unique Differentiators to Consider
1. Pricing transparency — Only 2 of 60+ list prices
2. Financing — Only 3 of 60+ offer it
3. Eco-friendly / low-VOC — Only 1 of 60+ positions here (Lifetime Green)
4. Floor visualizer — Only 2 of 60+ have one
5. Video content — 0 of 60+ use it well
6. Specialist positioning — Many competitors are generalists (painters, facility cleaners, general contractors)
7. Epoxy countertops as add-on — Only A1 does this
8. Warranty clarity — Range from none to lifetime to 5-year to 10-year. Clear lifetime warranty differentiates.
