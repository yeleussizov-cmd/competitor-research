# Competitor Analysis: Orlando Concrete Coating Market

*Generated: January 2026*
*Based on analysis of 10 competitor websites*

---

## 1. What Competitors Are Doing Wrong

### 1.1 Almost Nobody Has a Blog

Only **Shark Coatings** has a real blog (50+ articles). Everyone else either has no blog or 1-2 token posts. This is the single biggest SEO gap in the market.

| Competitor | Blog Status |
|---|---|
| Shark Coatings | Yes - 50+ posts |
| Titan Garage Flooring | 2 posts only |
| Ox Floors | No (link exists, no content) |
| Tru Grit Coatings | No |
| DreamCrete Custom Creations | No (link exists, appears empty) |
| Wise Coatings of Orlando | No |
| Garage Living Orlando | No |
| Dual Stone Epoxy Floor | No |
| Olympus Concrete Coatings | No (link exists, no content) |
| Clever Coatings USA | No |

### 1.2 Thin Service Pages

Most competitors list services but don't have dedicated, detailed pages for each one:

- **Dual Stone** - All services on one page with short descriptions, no dedicated pages
- **Ox Floors** - Brief service descriptions, lacking technical specifications
- **Clever Coatings** - Almost no visible content at all
- **Olympus** - Service links exist but content is thin
- **Wise Coatings** - Brief descriptions lacking depth and keyword optimization
- **Tru Grit** - Only "epoxy flooring" mentioned, no service breakdown

### 1.3 Missing Testimonials / Social Proof

Despite having hundreds of Google reviews, most competitors fail to display them on their websites:

| Competitor | Google Reviews | Shown on Site |
|---|---|---|
| Shark Coatings | 1,388 | Some displayed |
| Ox Floors | 501 | Only 3 shown |
| Garage Living Orlando | 137 | Only 3 shown |
| Dual Stone Epoxy Floor | 131 | Only 4 brief quotes |
| Olympus Concrete Coatings | 91 | Zero testimonials |
| Clever Coatings USA | Unknown | Zero visible |

### 1.4 No FAQ Sections

Almost none of the competitors have FAQ sections on their websites. This is free SEO — Google loves FAQ schema markup and it targets long-tail searches.

- Only **Titan Garage Flooring** has FAQ content, but without proper schema markup
- Everyone else misses this entirely

### 1.5 No Before/After Galleries

Despite being a highly visual industry where results sell themselves:

- **DreamCrete** - No before/after galleries despite portfolio potential
- **Ox Floors** - Limited visual portfolio
- **Dual Stone** - No case studies or visual proof
- **Olympus** - No before/after content
- **Clever Coatings** - No gallery at all

### 1.6 Poor Technical SEO

- **Tru Grit Coatings** - Built on Wix, heavily JavaScript-dependent, search crawlers struggle to index content
- **Clever Coatings** - NitroPack JavaScript optimization makes content invisible to crawlers, minimal visible text
- **Dual Stone** - No meta descriptions, no dedicated service pages
- **Olympus** - Generic title tags, no visible meta descriptions
- **Ox Floors** - Sparse location pages with minimal unique content

### 1.7 No Video Content

Not a single competitor uses video effectively:

- No installation walkthrough videos
- No video testimonials
- No YouTube strategy
- No embedded video on service pages
- Titan mentions a YouTube channel but has no video content on their site

### 1.8 No Pricing Transparency

Zero competitors share any pricing information. Even a "starting from" range or cost guide would capture high-intent searches:

- Nobody has a pricing page
- Nobody has a cost guide or estimator
- Nobody addresses "how much does epoxy flooring cost" on their site

### 1.9 Weak CTAs (Calls to Action)

- **Garage Living** - CTAs not prominent above the fold
- **DreamCrete** - Generic "Contact Us" and "Let's Connect"
- **Clever Coatings** - Just "Submit" buttons
- **Olympus** - Heavy reliance on form submissions, no educational content
- Most competitors use generic CTAs instead of specific, compelling ones

### 3.4 Competitor-Specific Strategies

**To beat Shark Coatings (market leader):**
- Their blog articles are generic, not Orlando-specific. Write better, locally-focused content.
- They cover 100+ cities broadly. We can go deeper on Orlando/Central Florida specifically.
- They don't have pricing content. We can capture high-intent cost searches.

**To beat Wise Coatings:**
- They have a proprietary "POLYWISE" brand but thin website content. Out-content them with detailed service pages and blog.
- Their location pages exist but lack unique content. We can create richer, city-specific pages.

**To beat DreamCrete:**
- They claim NASA/Disney clients but have no blog and weak service pages. We can outrank them on informational searches.
- Their FAQ section is missing. We can dominate question-based searches.

**To beat Tru Grit:**
- Built on Wix with poor crawlability. Our Astro-built site will outperform technically.
- They only target Lakeland. We own Orlando entirely.

**To beat Titan Garage Flooring:**
- They have a lifetime warranty (strong) but only 2 blog posts. We can dominate content.
- Their FAQ content lacks schema markup. We implement proper structured data.

**To beat Ox Floors:**
- Factory-direct pricing claim but no actual pricing content. We publish cost guides.
- Only 3 testimonials shown despite 501 Google reviews. We showcase 20+.

**To beat Dual Stone:**
- No service pages, no blog, no location targeting. Easy to outrank on everything.
- One-day installation (their USP) — we match this claim and add more content around it.

**To beat Clever Coatings:**
- Almost no visible content. Any real content strategy will outrank them.

**To beat Olympus:**
- Veteran-owned (nice differentiator) but zero testimonials on site and no blog.
- We can outrank them on all service keywords with proper content.

**To beat Garage Living:**
- They're a franchise focused on full garage renovation, not just coatings. We specialize.
- No blog, no FAQ, minimal testimonials. Content wins.
